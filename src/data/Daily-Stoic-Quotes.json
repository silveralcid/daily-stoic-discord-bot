We start with coffee in the morning, and soon enough we can't start the day without it. We check our email because it's part of our job, and soon enough we feel the phantom buzz of the phone in our pocket every few seconds. Soon enough, these harmless habits are running our lives. The little compulsions and drives we have not only chip away at our freedom and sovereignty, they cloud our clarity. We think we're in control but are we really? As one addict put it, addiction is when we' ve lost the freedom to abstain. Let us reclaim that freedom. What that addiction is for you can vary: Soda? Drugs? Complaining? Gossip? The Internet? Biting your nails? But you must reclaim the ability to abstain because within it is your clarity and self-control.

I begin to speak only when I'm certain what I'll say isn't better left unsaid.'",

Those were the days, they might say, even though now they live in much better circumstances. To be young and hungry again, another might say wistfully. It was the best thing that ever happened to me, or I wouldn't change a thing about it. As tough as those periods were, they were ultimately formative experiences. They made those people who they are. There's another benefit of so-called misfortune. Having experienced and survived it, we walk away with a better understanding of our own capacity and inner strength. Passing a trial by fire is empowering because you know that in the future you can survive similar adversity. What does not kill me makes me stronger, Nietzsche said.

How much more unconquerable if its judgments are careful and made rationally? Therefore, the mind freed from passions is an impenetrable fortress a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time.  MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 8.48 B ruce Lee once made an interesting claim: I fear not the man who has practiced ten thousand kicks once, he said, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick ten thousand times. When we repeat an action so often it becomes unconscious behavior, we can default to it without thinking. Training in the martial arts or combat is a deeply thoughtful study of movement. We sometimes think of soldiers as automatons, but what they've actually built is a steady pattern of unconscious behaviors. Any of us can build these. When Marcus says that a mind can get to a place where it won't do anything contrary to its own will, even if its position is irrational, what he means is that proper training can change your default habits. Train yourself to give up anger, and you won't be angry at every fresh slight. Train yourself to avoid gossip, and you won't get pulled into it. Train yourself on any habit, and yov'll be able to unconsciously go to that habit in trying times. Think about which behaviors you'd like to be able to default to if you could.

Or we could look out at that very same day and rejoice at the one thing we do control: the ability to decide what any event means. This second option offers the ultimate power a true and fair form of control. If you had control over other people, wouldn't other people have control over you?
